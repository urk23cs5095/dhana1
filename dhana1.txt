To Install Git And Creating Repositories.

DESCRIPTION:
GIT: Git is a version control system that allows developers to track changes in their code.
GITHUB: GitHub is a web-based hosting service for git repositories.
REPOSITORY: Repository is the most basic element of GitHub. It’s a place where you can
store your code,your files,and revision history.Repositories can have multiple collaborators and
be either private or public.
STEP BY STEP PROCEDURE:

Double-click the executable you just downloaded, then click "Next" to move through the

installation prompts.
The first is the text editor Git will use. The default selection is Vim. Vim is ubiquitous and a
hallmark of command-line interfaces everywhere but learning to use its idiosyncratic
commands can be daunting. You should probably pick something else instead, like Visual
Studio Code, Sublime, NotePad++, or any other plain text editor you like.

The second is the way Git integrates itself into your PC's PATH. Make sure that the "Git
From The Command Line And Also From 3rd-Party Software" is selected.

Click through the remaining options, and wait for everything to finish downloading. The time
requires to download everything will vary depending on what you chose to install. The default

selection results in a download that is about 270 megabytes.

MANAGING PRIVATE AND PUBLIC REPOSITORY
MAKING A REPOSITORY PRIVATE:
* GitHub will detach public forks of the public repository and put them into a new
network. Public forks are not made private.
* If you're using GitHub Free for personal accounts or organizations, some features won't
be available in the repository after you change the visibility to private. Any published
GitHub Pages site will be automatically unpublished. If you added a custom domain to
the GitHub Pages site, you should remove or update your DNS records before making
the repository private, to avoid the risk of a domain takeover.
* GitHub will no longer include the repository in the GitHub Archive Program.
* GitHub Advanced Security features, such as code scanning, will stop working.

MAKING A REPOSITORY PUBLIC:
* GitHub will detach private forks and turn them into a standalone private repository.
* If you're converting your private repository to a public repository as part of a move
toward creating an open source project.
* Once your repository is public, you can also view your repository's community profile
to see whether your project meets best practices for supporting contributors.
* The repository will automatically gain access to GitHub Advanced Security features.
Changing a repository’s Visibility
1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Under your repository name, click Settings. If you cannot see the "Settings" tab, select
the dropdown menu, then click Settings.

3. In the "Danger Zone" section, to the right of to "Change repository visibility",
click Change visibility.
4. Select a visibility.
5. To verify that you're changing the correct repository's visibility, type the name of the
repository you want to change the visibility of.
6. Click I understand, change repository visibility.
